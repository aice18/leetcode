//I have solved it using brute force approach.
//In this brute force approach, we use two loops to compare each number with every other number in the array to find a pair that sums up to the target. 
//The outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs n times as well, leading to a total of n * n iterations.
