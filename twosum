//I have solved it using brute force approach.
//In this brute force approach, we use two loops to compare each number with every other number in the array to find a pair that sums up to the target. 
//The outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs n times as well, leading to a total of n * n iterations.
//Time Complexity: O(n2). Where n is the length of the array. This is because for each element in the array, we are checking every other element.
Space Complexity: O(1). This solution does not use any additional data structures that grow with input size; it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables.
